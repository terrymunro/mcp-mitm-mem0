# Claude Code Hooks Integration for MCP MITM Mem0

**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: Approved and In Progress  
**Estimated Effort**: 14-19 hours across 5 phases

## Project Overview

Transform our reactive memory system into a proactive intelligence layer using Claude Code hooks to guarantee memory consultation and pattern recognition, ensuring Claude never misses relevant context or repeats solved problems.

## Background & Motivation

Our current MCP MITM Mem0 project suffers from a fundamental limitation: it relies on Claude's autonomous decision-making to use memory tools. Despite extensive descriptions and trigger patterns, Claude may:
- Start working without checking relevant memories
- Miss patterns that could prevent repeated errors  
- Fail to maintain context across sessions
- Not recognize when past solutions apply to current problems

**Claude Code hooks solve this by providing deterministic execution** - memory operations happen automatically at specific lifecycle points, regardless of Claude's reasoning state.

## Phase 1: Hook Infrastructure (2-3 hours)

### Core Components
- **Memory Hook Scripts**: Python scripts that interface with our MCP memory service
- **JSON I/O Handlers**: Parse hook input and return structured responses  
- **Memory Query Helpers**: Streamlined functions for common memory operations
- **Configuration Templates**: Pre-built hook configurations for different scenarios

### Deliverables
- `hooks/memory_search.py` - Search memories and return relevant context
- `hooks/memory_store.py` - Auto-store outcomes and solutions
- `hooks/memory_analyze.py` - Trigger reflection analysis
- `hooks/utils.py` - Common helper functions
- Hook configuration templates for user/project settings

### Technical Details
- Hook scripts will communicate with MCP server via direct Python imports
- JSON-based I/O following Claude Code hook specifications
- Error handling and graceful degradation when memory service unavailable
- Performance optimization for sub-second execution

## Phase 2: Session Intelligence (3-4 hours)

### Stop Hooks - Session Awareness
- **Auto-analyze conversations** when Claude finishes responding
- **Load relevant context** for next interaction based on conversation content
- **Trigger reflection analysis** after significant problem-solving sessions
- **Surface incomplete projects** from previous sessions

### Notification Hooks - Permission Intelligence  
- **Check memories** when Claude requests permission for operations
- **Surface previous solutions** for similar permission requests
- **Warn about recurring issues** before they happen again

### Implementation Strategy
- Stop hook analyzes last N messages and preloads relevant memories
- Notification hook searches for context around requested operations
- Integration with reflection agent for automatic pattern analysis
- Silent operation unless critical insights are found

## Phase 3: Proactive Memory Integration (4-5 hours)

### PreToolUse Hooks - Before Action Intelligence
- **Bash Commands**: Search for previous executions and outcomes before running
- **File Operations**: Load file history and related work before editing
- **Web/API Calls**: Check for previous similar operations and results
- **Code Writing**: Surface related code patterns and established preferences

### PostToolUse Hooks - Learning Capture
- **Success Storage**: Auto-store successful solutions and approaches
- **Error Documentation**: Capture error resolutions for future reference
- **Preference Learning**: Store discovered user preferences automatically
- **Pattern Recognition**: Feed successful patterns to reflection agent

### Hook Targets
- `Bash` - Command execution with context
- `Edit|MultiEdit` - File modification intelligence
- `Write` - New file creation with patterns
- `Read` - Context loading for file access
- `mcp__.*` - All MCP tool usage patterns

## Phase 4: Advanced Pattern Recognition (3-4 hours)

### Error Prevention
- **Block risky operations** based on previous failures
- **Suggest alternatives** from successful memory patterns
- **Surface debugging context** for recurring errors
- **Provide automatic fixes** for known issues

### Project Continuity
- **Auto-load project context** when working with specific files/directories
- **Resume incomplete work** by surfacing unfinished projects
- **Maintain coding standards** by referencing established patterns
- **Track project evolution** over time

### Intelligence Features
- Pattern matching for common error types (CORS, TypeScript, dependency issues)
- Project detection based on file paths and git repositories
- Context aggregation for complex multi-file projects
- Automatic documentation of architectural decisions

## Phase 5: Reflection Integration (2-3 hours)

### Automatic Reflection
- **Trigger reflection analysis** based on conversation patterns
- **Schedule periodic reviews** of memory patterns
- **Identify knowledge gaps** automatically
- **Surface learning opportunities** proactively

### Memory Curation
- **Organize memory categories** automatically
- **Deduplicate similar memories** intelligently
- **Archive outdated information** safely
- **Prioritize high-value memories** for quick access

### Enhanced Intelligence
- Deeper integration with our existing reflection agent
- Automated memory lifecycle management
- Smart categorization based on content analysis
- Proactive insight surfacing

## Expected Benefits

### Immediate Impact
1. **Guaranteed Memory Consultation**: Never miss relevant past context
2. **Proactive Problem Prevention**: Stop repeated errors before they happen
3. **Seamless Learning**: Automatically capture and apply lessons learned

### Long-term Value
4. **Enhanced Continuity**: Pick up where previous sessions left off
5. **Intelligent Assistance**: Surface relevant help before it's needed
6. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Less need to remember to check memories

## Technical Architecture

### Hook Communication Flow
```
Claude Tool Call → Hook Script → Memory Service → Response → Claude
```

### Key Components
- **Hook Scripts**: Python scripts in `/hooks/` directory
- **Memory Interface**: Direct imports of our MCP memory service
- **JSON Protocol**: Standard Claude Code hook input/output format
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- **Performance Layer**: Caching and optimization for rapid execution

### Security Considerations
- Hooks execute with user permissions - validate all inputs
- Memory operations are read-heavy with selective writes
- Error handling prevents hook failures from blocking Claude
- Audit logging for all automatic memory operations

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase-by-Phase Deployment
1. **Start Conservative**: Stop hooks for session intelligence only
2. **Add High-Impact**: PreToolUse hooks for Bash and Edit tools
3. **Expand Gradually**: Full proactive integration across all tools
4. **Monitor & Tune**: Performance optimization and pattern refinement
5. **User Feedback**: Collect usage data and adjust behavior

### Configuration Management
- User-level hooks for global behavior
- Project-level hooks for specific workflows
- Local override capability for special cases
- Template library for common patterns

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- **Reduction in repeated error patterns** (track error type frequencies)
- **Increased relevant memory usage** (measure search hit rates)
- **Faster problem resolution times** (time to solution metrics)

### Qualitative Indicators
- **Higher user satisfaction** with context awareness
- **Improved learning** from past sessions
- **Better project continuity** across session boundaries

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Phases 1-2 (Hook infrastructure + Session intelligence)
- **Week 2**: Phase 3 (Proactive memory integration)
- **Week 3**: Phases 4-5 (Pattern recognition + Reflection integration)
- **Week 4**: Testing, optimization, and documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance**: Hooks must execute quickly (<1 second)
- **Reliability**: Memory service failures shouldn't break hooks
- **Security**: Automatic operations require careful validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Security review of all automatic operations
- User control over hook behavior and frequency

## Future Enhancements

### Beyond Initial Implementation
- **Learning Acceleration**: Hooks that identify and fill knowledge gaps
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared memory patterns across team members
- **Advanced Analytics**: Deep pattern analysis and recommendation engine
- **Custom Workflows**: User-defined hook patterns for specific use cases
