# Claude Code Hooks for MCP MITM Mem0

This directory contains Claude Code hooks that provide **deterministic memory integration** - ensuring Claude always has access to relevant context and automatically captures learning without relying on autonomous decision-making.

## üéØ What This Solves

Without hooks, our memory system relies on Claude **choosing** to use MCP tools:
- ‚ùå Claude might forget to check memories
- ‚ùå Important solutions might not get stored  
- ‚ùå Patterns might go unrecognized
- ‚ùå Context might be lost between sessions

With hooks, memory operations happen **automatically**:
- ‚úÖ Relevant memories surface before every operation
- ‚úÖ Successful outcomes are automatically stored
- ‚úÖ Patterns are analyzed after each session
- ‚úÖ Context is never lost

## üìÅ Hook Scripts

### `memory_search.py` (PreToolUse Hook)
**Purpose**: Search memories before tool execution to provide relevant context

**Triggers**: Before Bash, Edit, Write, Task, and MCP tool operations
**Benefits**: 
- Prevents repeating solved problems
- Surfaces relevant past solutions
- Blocks operations that have repeatedly failed
- Provides context for file modifications

### `memory_store.py` (PostToolUse Hook)  
**Purpose**: Automatically store successful outcomes and solutions

**Triggers**: After successful Bash, Edit, Write, Task operations
**Benefits**:
- Captures solutions without Claude needing to remember
- Builds knowledge base of successful approaches
- Stores project context and preferences
- Creates searchable history of work

### `memory_analyze.py` (Stop Hook)
**Purpose**: Analyze conversation patterns when Claude finishes responding

**Triggers**: When Claude stops responding (session end)
**Benefits**:
- Identifies recurring issues automatically
- Surfaces incomplete projects
- Generates insights about user patterns
- Improves future assistance

### `permission_intelligence.py` (Notification Hook)
**Purpose**: Provide intelligent context when Claude requests permission for operations

**Triggers**: When Claude shows permission/notification dialogs
**Benefits**:
- Warns about risky operations based on past failures
- Surfaces relevant context for permission decisions
- Prevents repeated mistakes by showing past issues
- Provides confidence when operations have worked before

### `session_context.py` (Stop Hook)
**Purpose**: Automatically load relevant project and session context at session start

**Triggers**: When starting new sessions (stop_hook_active=False)
**Benefits**:
- Immediately provides project context and recent work
- Surfaces incomplete projects and ongoing issues
- Loads relevant preferences and decisions
- Ensures continuity between sessions

### `pre_response_hook.py` (PreResponse Hook)
**Purpose**: Detect error patterns in Claude's responses and inject prevention suggestions

**Triggers**: Before Claude's responses are displayed to the user
**Benefits**:
- Detects potential errors before they occur
- Injects prevention suggestions based on past solutions
- Learns from similar errors in memory
- Provides proactive guidance to avoid repeated mistakes

### `project_continuity_hook.py` (Notification Hook)
**Purpose**: Track project state and maintain continuity across sessions

**Triggers**: On conversation start/end notifications
**Benefits**:
- Captures project state (files modified, commands run, current tasks)
- Stores state for next session continuation
- Provides previous project context at session start
- Ensures seamless project handoffs between sessions

### `auto_reflection_hook.py` (PostToolUse/PreResponse Hook)
**Purpose**: Automatically trigger reflection based on conversation complexity and patterns

**Triggers**: After tool use or before responses when thresholds are met
**Benefits**:
- Triggers reflection after 20 messages, 3 errors, or 15 tool uses
- Analyzes conversation complexity to determine reflection needs
- Stores reflection insights as special memories
- Resets counters after successful reflection

### `memory_curation_hook.py` (PostToolUse Hook)
**Purpose**: Enhance stored memories with metadata for better retrieval

**Triggers**: After memories are stored (mcp__memory__add_memory)
**Benefits**:
- Automatically categorizes memories (error_solution, configuration, etc.)
- Extracts entities (filenames, commands, error types)
- Links related memories together
- Adds search keywords and tags for improved retrieval

### `utils.py`
**Purpose**: Common functionality shared by all hooks

**Features**:
- JSON I/O handling for hook communication
- Memory service interface functions
- Error handling and logging
- Helper functions for content analysis

### `setup_hooks.py`
**Purpose**: Interactive setup and configuration generator

**Features**:
- Makes scripts executable
- Generates Claude Code hook configurations
- Provides installation instructions
- Creates sample configuration files

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Run Setup
```bash
cd hooks/
python setup_hooks.py
```

### 2. Choose Template
- **full_integration**: Complete memory system with search, storage, and analysis
- **memory_search_only**: Just context before operations (safest start)
- **error_prevention**: Focus on preventing repeated command failures
- **learning_focused**: Emphasize capturing and analyzing outcomes
- **conservative**: Only session-end analysis

### 3. Install Configuration
Copy the generated configuration to one of:
- `~/.claude/settings.json` (all projects)
- `.claude/settings.json` (this project only)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` (local development)

### 4. Test
Run any bash command or edit a file - you should see memory context appear automatically!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running
1. Check path in hook command matches your installation
2. Verify scripts are executable: `ls -la hooks/*.py`
3. Check Claude Code hook configuration: `/hooks` command

### No Memory Results
1. Verify MCP MITM Mem0 service is running
2. Check memory service has data: test MCP tools directly
3. Review hook execution logs: `~/.claude/hook_execution.log`

### Import Errors
1. Ensure you're in the project directory when hooks run
2. Verify mcp_mitm_mem0 package is installed: `uv run python -c "import mcp_mitm_mem0"`
3. Check Python path includes project directory

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce hook frequency by limiting `matcher` patterns
2. Check hook execution times in logs
3. Consider using only high-value hooks (Bash, Edit)

## üìù Customization

### Target Specific Tools
```json
{
  "matcher": "Bash",  // Only bash commands
  "matcher": "Edit|MultiEdit|Write",  // File operations only  
  "matcher": "mcp__.*",  // All MCP tools
  "matcher": "",  // All tools
}
```
